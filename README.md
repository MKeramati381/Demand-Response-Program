This code proposes an optimization framework for siting and sizing energy storage systems (ESS) in smart distribution networks, considering demand response programs (DRP) and network constraints. Using a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model solved in GAMS, the framework minimizes costs and improves performance by integrating renewable energy, diesel generators, and load management. Results from a modified IEEE 33-bus system show significant cost savings and enhanced network efficiency, especially when combining ESS and DRP.
